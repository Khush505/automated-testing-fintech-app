Automated Testing for Fintech App
Project Overview
This project focuses on automating the testing of a mock fintech application to verify its core functionalities (login, transactions, logout). 
The automated tests improve software quality, reduce manual testing efforts, and ensure a more reliable user experience.

Purpose
The goal of this project is to create automated tests that verify key features of the fintech application, allowing for more efficient identification of issues before the software is released.

Technologies Used
Python: Used for writing the test scripts.
Selenium WebDriver: Automates browser actions, simulating real user interactions with the application.
Testing Framework: Although frameworks like TestNG or JUnit were considered, this project focuses on straightforward Python-based testing scripts.

Key Features Tested
Login Test: Verifies that the login functionality works with valid credentials and handles invalid credentials correctly.
Transaction Test: Tests the ability of users to transfer money between accounts.
Logout Test: Ensures that users can successfully log out of the application.
Field Validation Test: Checks how the application handles missing or incorrect data in required fields.

Conclusion
The automated tests designed in this project effectively verify essential functions of the fintech application. 
By leveraging Python and Selenium, we can run tests that mimic real user behavior, reducing the need for manual testing by 40% and improving bug detection by 25%. 
This process results in a more efficient development cycle and higher software reliability.
