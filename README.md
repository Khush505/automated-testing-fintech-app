# automated-testing-fintech-app
Automated testing suite for a mock fintech application using Selenium WebDriver.

Project Proposal: Automated Testing for Fintech App

Project Overview
This project aims to develop an automated testing suite for a mock fintech application, focusing on functional and regression tests for core features like login, transactions, and logout. By leveraging Selenium WebDriver and a testing framework (e.g., TestNG/JUnit), the goal is to create reusable and efficient test cases that ensure software quality and minimize manual testing efforts.

Objectives
Develop automated test scripts for core app functionalities (login, transactions, logout).
Perform regression and smoke testing to validate the appâ€™s stability.
Ensure that automated tests are reusable, efficient, and can easily be integrated into CI/CD pipelines in the future.

Scope of Work
The automated testing project will cover the following:

Functional Tests: Login, transaction, and logout functionality.
Validation Tests: Error handling and field validation for key forms.
Regression Tests: Testing to ensure no functionality is broken with updates.
Reporting: Documentation summarizing test coverage and results.

Technologies & Tools
Selenium WebDriver: For automated browser testing.
TestNG / JUnit: For organizing and executing test cases.
Mock Fintech App: As the test environment.

Deliverables
Fully functional automated test scripts for login, transactions, and logout.
A simple test report outlining the test cases, coverage, and any issues encountered.
